TODO - Up next:

- Make one universal card-register that has all cards so I don't have to search cards in stack, players inv, etc. and can rely on them all being there for sure
- Make removing from inventory work (fix above should be most of the work)
- Add button to leave attack and automatically start next attack
- Add actual requirements when attacking and defending
- Improve UI
- Everything else
